<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Adrenergic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>α Blockers</li><li>β Blockers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-adrenergic agent market comprises α-blockers and β-blockers, which are primarily used to manage conditions like hypertension and heart disorders. α-blockers work by inhibiting the effects of adrenalin on alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. β-blockers, on the other hand, block beta-adrenergic receptors, decreasing heart rate and contractility, thus managing arrhythmias and heart failure. Both categories are vital in treating cardiovascular diseases, with their applications extending to anxiety and migraine prevention.</p></p>
